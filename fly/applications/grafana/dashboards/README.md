# Dashboards

These are the JSON definitions of the dashboards set up in grafana. They are manually backed up by me. This is not ideal. The backlog has a task to cook the dashboards into the docker image, or load them into the mounted persistent /data volume, or something. This is a fall-back solution until that is implemented.

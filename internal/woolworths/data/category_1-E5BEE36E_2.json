// This is a terrible hack, since we're processing this payload
// with regexes rather than parsing a mass of JSON we aren't
// interested in.

// Note we're relying on the fact the TotalRecordCount is updated
// per request. The initial request says there are 470 records to
// query, but this payload overrides it with 38, so it doesn't request
// page 3.
